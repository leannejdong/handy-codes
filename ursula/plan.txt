Deadline(April): Linearize the nonlinear system

Steps:
1. Linearize the system, See
Quadratic equations for hydraulic (eq2.10 Liu's thesis)
Hydraulic case (2.9)
2. Solve the equation system; 
Test the solver

Misc:
Consider now nonlinear case (Diode)
Flow in electrical sense is current
Flow in hydraulic is massflow
Efforts is a driving force


Tasks for Students:
Programming blocks in C++
